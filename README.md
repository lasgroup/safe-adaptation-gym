# learn2learn-safely
A Safety-Gym based benchmark suite for safe meta reinforcement learning

Separate into three categories: MDP variations due to reward and CMDP variations due to costs, MDP variations on the actions (e.g., disable doggo's leg)


# TODO 
1. Think of the different classes of task. For instance, where does the variability in tasks arises from?
2. Think what would be the best implementation. My current hunch is Wrappers of Sgym envs.
3. Think.
